Salient features
ELMo representations are:

Contextual: The representation for each word depends on the entire context in which it is used.
Deep: The word representations combine all layers of a deep pre-trained neural network.
Character based: ELMo representations are purely character based, allowing the network to use morphological clues to form robust representations for out-of-vocabulary tokens unseen in training.
